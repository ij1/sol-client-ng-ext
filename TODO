UPSTREAM bugs?
- renderer for padding causes infinite recursion error in vue, possible related to conditional rendering

BUGS:
- TWA predictor discrepancies, try adding 10sec heuristics, still a problem?
- Fleet layer & traces out-of-sync after multiple highlight pans
- Safari (v10) draws black wind arrows/barbs but correctly colored predictor & polar bg curve colors
- iPad crosshair missing? (mullionman)
- iPad missing chat "send" button

Check:
- Verify that there are no useless tile redraws (print redraw count to tile).
- Chrome dc dot w/o cc/twa values
- up/down keys in chat textarea don't work with something? FF doesn't always work.

Other bits
- Tools buttons don't work well with wheel.png
- validate delay better in mutation to prevent errors spreading
- Don't auto-delete DCs when server is broken (to allow deleting old DCs).
- limit contours drawing to existing tile ranges
	- This is hard than I initially thought. Maybe keep track of lon array 1+ tiles state?
- check all store diag calls to have root: true argument
- refactor solapi stats init so that stat setup can be called independently (tiled wx fetch loop should report errors through there)
- multiple "start" DCs and/or other DCs during towback
- towback aware predictor
- dc checkbox auto
- polar vmg markers (on map ones in particular)
- "reset" button quick help
- contours func to use tile indexes properly
- refactor wx fetching code
- cleanup wx layers when wx meta is fetched
- linkify chat & in-race messages?
- center on DC button?
- DC marker wrap copies
- don't use dcFetchTime but figure out if DCs were really changed
- gybe to +180 shows "tack" button
- wx update markers on predictor
- dc markers only major w/ low-zoom (setTimeout local data var to reduce load on update)
- init transient can have boat id != null but no instruments (break at least predictor?)
- race between dc auto-reload and expiring command (visual & also commit race)
- delete first in ruler does not update total distance, should it?
- non-existing chat channel in config (if made invisible) works?
- polar butterfly at wx dot
- Reactivity fails for latLng (null -> non-null fails), at least delayLatLng
- Miniscule wx cell TWS contours speed ups (draw only on edges)
- Save leaderboard sort column
- Splitpanes save & restore & multi-orientation handling
- Trace length limiter
- POI notes field
- Dual own trace removal when own boat is in fleettraces
- Send steering button feedback improvement
- Change tab while dc update in progress closes the editor?? Does it?
- Steering retry & correct time offsets inside the post call's caller
- Move wx cell size into frame to allow multi sized
	- Allow cell size switch, fake midpoint data by interpolating
- WX tiles
- New DC API code & testing
- Boat keys zindex, behind the fleet boats?
- Standalone => unauthenticated before retrying, multiple tries & late failure
	- Timestamp for parallel logins to skip earlier initialized
- DC list possibly stale warning
- Nav lights on boat, solve the scaling challenge, add option for hull+lights
- Add icon for tools custom from pos, or red GC arc
- Dim GC/Rh from tools when bearing is written manually.
- separate tools bearing input from bearing used for calculations (refactor)

- Support stealth fleet mode (no position, cog, traces, dtf/dbl?)

- Dark TODO: graticules, no blend at all for label bgs?
- POI popup captures events (try as tooltips to have more control?)
- Map graticules / grid
	- FIX tiles edge drawn when the canvas is cropped from the tile graticule
- Boatlists editor, handle non-racing names cleanly
- Tweak MAX_LATITUDE of Leaflet's SphericalMercator projection (extend it)
- Prune chat messages if needed
- Fix splitpanes resized caused windmap movement
- Add Vue.config.errorHandler to catch remaining errors

- Enter key higher prio popup focus handling when DC editor field/button has focus
- Select boats from map click in default ui mode, generalize hover find boats code

- DC list time delta column
- Highlight DCs with same time with red
- Highlight DCs with out-of-range COG/TWAs

- Predictor 10s at beginning
- POI meteogram
- POI small circles, to boat, to x nm

- Improve terminator & x3 it for twilights, #bbb only darkens colors a little
- Always/auto-select toggle for leaderboard lists (now easy w the new getter)
- Scroll position saving & chat room change scroll
- Selected DC saved

- Add generic poi/mark/boat targeter
- Localstore, clear previous race message shown ids, before that validate races.xml?filter=active to have at least the current race id

- 0.5px quirks to fleet & land
- Longer hover tooltips for all buttons & input fields & table headers.
- Add expected courses list on clearing DCs & when doing steering
	- If current course not on list, trigger reloading all DCs

- Polar touch "hover"
- Validate WX cells vs bounds
- TWS contours gaps
- Quick access for gc/loxo, leader, polar always, arrows/barbs
- Reregister in timed races
- Upgrade sol/guest -> own credentials
- Larger draw outside renderer value, maybe make it configurable if perf impact
- Improve error reporting when invalid data arrives, the rest
- Network debug: click error number for errors popup
- boatlist lastclicked to store to avoid forgetting it?
- SOL API Time sync after start
- Pruning loaded tiles to free memory, add zero refCounted lists, do this only if needed.
- Predictors, consider performance improvements (smaller parts, bboxes, multi canvases)
- Put not moved into fleet and use as TWA=0 heuristic (towback needs to be taken into account)
- Race component fetch backup timer (if boat API dies)
- API calls, general robustness checks everywhere before accepting data
	- Normalize cog/twa angles safely (brainaid etc may input us garbage)
	- Boatname valid characters, enforce too
	- Try e-17 format with all instruments
- Robust wx time parser (support also != 4 entries + validate time)
	- These should be provided in xml by the server though
- VMC towards finish line on the last leg rather than the middle point
- Scale: use own calc based on lat, not map.distance to use correct EARTH_R
- API call prepare code safety (make sure bugs don't stall API retry loop)
- TWA given with "Port" / "P" / "Starboard" / "S" suffix
- TWA ~ 0 causes the TWA predictor to look large blob at the boat or other issues with markers not on predictor line (at least with +0.01)
- Dblclick timer ok?
- Notes?
- 100 nearest boats shown?
- Ability to compare prev & this wx (at least predictors)
- Ruler: show opposite heading
- Ruler wrap, detect anti-meridian crossing from mouse movements during panning
- Notification (any incl chat) sound.
- Popup zindex bring-to-top feature on titlebar click
- Local trace intersection finding (for recent turns)
- WX comparator (old wx vs current)
- Race planner (tile set changer, wp naming, wp moving)
- Trace wrap handler for >360 degree races
- Popup drag with hover
- No chatrooms in auth_raceinfo leads to crash, only one room leads to crash
- Still too frequent map tile retries
- Distance-in-lead
- Refetching race messages?
- Could skip fetching wx with - in the name
- Predictor refactor
	- Predictor to normal Leaflet polyline. Is there enough accuracy? Leaflet allows configuring pruning for polylines
	- Link predictor markers on hover to DC tab
	- Aiming from predictor?
	- Planning only predictor?
	- Old wx predictor stored

DC list other
	- Better time sync support, figure out optimal delay fixup delta
		- How to counter latency spikes
		- Or better DC setting API, please!
	- Allow exec immediately (+clear DCs before it too?)
	- Editor
		- Support add new (without deleting the old one)
		- Validate unique time
	- Multiselect, generalize boatlist multiselect into mixin
	- Show the time until DC fires somewhere for every DC?

Refactors
	- kntToMs / msToKnt improvement, conv.js + constants for all conversions
	- consider transforming API data @ fetch time to avoid most of knt/ms conversions
	- Map events using vue2leaflet style, any to do? 2 in map.vue?
	- veevalidate consider, looked too complicated but might be good
	- generic timedelta -> string converter (as component?)
	- config label component for ("experimental" or such easy add ones)
	- check all L.latLng to avoid GCs if possible
	- freq used functions, check if returning objects necessary (e.g., twd/tws calcs?)
	- Tiles try remove waitList clearing
	- Check if splitting in wx code needs also some idle calls, could take long?
	- Refactor multiselect from boatlists
	- Try projecting tiles beforehand, are the px values accurate?
	- Rework boat color creation, lots of useless object done there
	- name -> id map for msg during parse if available
	- ResizeObserver available in very late versions of all browsers!
	- wrappedLatLng -> raceLatLng

Visual low-prio stuff
- SYC flag preload to avoid header misposition (or use a timer)
- Add phantom container into hover coordinate to avoid constant bg resizing
- WX contour labels
- Improve wx slider fg color transparency
- Chat message max len tweak
- 2deg steer aim region?
- WX slider dragging show the wxTime in a "tooltip" above the slider
- Tool images
- Hide vs Show length in POI popup changes number of lines
- Boatlists by dtf distance
- Boatlists, select still highlights boats filtered away
- Try using tooltip for poi markers to make click functionality better
- select order in drawing fleet
- PR mark tooltip css to use zoom dependent padding?
- Towback start, refetch the fleet right away to avoid boats lingering on the sea
- After finishing, fetch fleet until own distance there becomes zero (for quicker results)
	- Sadly, no finish_time for boats in race API
- Start time change notification: calculate delta part
- allMessagesShown getter to racemessages.js (for tab highlight & alert)
- Delay fleet fetch by some seconds to allow server to move all boats
- Chatroom visual separation
- 9999 ranking order?
- Edge: transparency using CSS not supported (poi & tools)
- Perhaps use mark nearness to refetch race more often?
- Perhaps username component to offload charset tricks (if needed)?
- Leaderboard tooltips (LOG, DBL, others?)
- Leaderboard relative DTF mode
- Investigate: are own boat's zoom issues due to updated position during zooming?
- Two laps think how to make "Rounded" vs "Leave to ...", perhaps delta to current ordered z-indexing?
- DC editor label click focus response for "Type" & "Date" labels
- Wind map, how to do calcs also during zooming, I read it's complicated but would look cool
- Sail angle improvements
- Consider drawing speedups:
	- Use rbush for faster drawing when many small island polys in a tile?
	- Avoid drawing complexity outside the screen (skip all points when in
	  the same side of a border)
- Graticules lat/lon numbers
- Draw leader on top to canvas (trace z-index too for own+leader?)
- Sort tile fetch list based on closeness to the center (needs map center tile information), add refCount === 0 into front to kill them as soon as possible
- race message datetime layouting, current title rows have an impact
- When anti-meridian is visible, instead of tile reuse, create shadow copies to -360/+360 to avoid tile flicker on pan over 180
- Brainaid style DC list, include button for abort everything related to DCs
- Only remove points from trace with dst > last trace point (how to handle tight turns then?)
- Perhaps use flyToBounds also for zooming if it gives more cb calls during zooming?
- Make steering button width constant
- Chat sizing to use flex / or dragable sizes?
- Textbox border everywhere (try global styling)
- Fix initial race area center sets >180 lngs?
- Placenames map
- Steering delay focus save
- Timed race duplicate names filter
- BBQ/TWA0 detection improvements (but only for non-buddies)
- Chat high priority fetching support (for newly opened languages, active chats, recently sent chats)
- Configrange, show current value
- Fix predictor or trace staleness (one tick horizontal line after pan)
- Polar url in links? From auth?
- "Reset" should consider not yet visible turns too (maybe block button until the next boat tick?)
- Wind level line for command boat
- Ruler:
	- Bearing to other boat? Can be done by locking ruler points to boats
	- Improve label display position, myabe use CSS to rotate the label?

Configs
	- Steering digits: (2-4)
	- Max distinct boats show on hover: range
	- Background: dark blue sea, local day/night
	- DTF: default, synthetized
	- Route bisection lines bool (draw as dashed)?
	- Instrument change dir/rate-of-change bools
	- Pop-up race messages: pop-up, tab auto-select, tab alert (blinking !)
	- Direct steering retry timer (send)
	- DC editor retry timer
	- Fleet/traces fetch freq reduction for lower BW use
	- visual steering & steering tab fields in-sync (flash compatibility mode)?
	- PR mark labels bool
	- Steering button feedback mode ("slow UI"), something else was also in my mind but cannot remember it now


Warnings (to lower right corner?):
	- DCs with the same timestamp
	- DCs with an invalid value
	- No start commands set
	- Warn from DCs after start but no starting command
	- Warning when unwinding a mark rounding, maybe show the bisecting line too then? Perhaps use maxVMG triangle to filter out most spurious warnings & sailing away from the mark?
	- Warn from invalid WX
	- Clock offsets
	- Boat degraded mode (buggy chat)
	- Setting start DC but already one existing? Clear other commands?

Discussion needed:
- Custom target WPs for VMC & WPBRG calculations
- WPBRG with red/green/grey dot/arrow/pointer to polar
- Setting DCs, time calc: from the last boat tick or SOL realtime?
- Configs:
	- Predictor: extras (maxvmc, maxvmg, maxbs)?
	- Steering tool max VMG limiter bool
	- Dead-reckoning: off, own, nearby, all (or split to two?)
	- High-zoom (edge lenght > x) show coast angles
- Advanced config filtering out some of the config options (also think "SOTP" filter same time)
- Dual steering UI, one for manual, other for DC?
- PR mark cut detector?
- Good projection for polar region?

UPSTREAM bugs, all worked around currently:
- UTC fix
- LGridLayer fix
- gridlayer zoom Math.ceil feature
- gridlayer prune bug

Seems unfixable:
- Track down the reason for the update memory limit warnings
